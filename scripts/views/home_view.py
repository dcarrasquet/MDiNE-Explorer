           species. iMDiNE exploits the original MDiNE framework to have robust inferences 
           on the associations between taxa. Moreover, the tool allows the user to identify 
           core variables associated with species, exploiting powerful Bayesian feature 
           selection strategies, such as the Horseshoe, LASSO or Ridge. The model is 
           divided into 3 main steps, the data import and pre-processing, the model and 
           the network vizualization. Result export is also possible in the corresponding 
           tab. Below, we provide general guidelines and details for each step.
